# Create a function called add_songs().
# It receives one or many tuples. Each tuple consists of exactly two elements - the song's title in the first position
# and a list in the second position. The list can consist of one, many, or no strings - each representing a line of the
# lyrics of the song.
# The function collects the information and concatenates the lyrics for each song (each string on a different line).
# If you are given the same song more than once, add the additional lyrics (if ones are given) to the lyrics of the song.
# In the end, it should return a string for each song with its lyrics in the format:
# "- {song_title}"
# "{first_line_of_lyrics}"
# "{second_line_of_lyrics}"
# â€¦
# "{nth_line_of_lyrics}"
# If there are no lyrics given for a song, return just its title in the format shown above.
