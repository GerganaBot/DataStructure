﻿# Create a function called even_odd_filter() that can receive a different number of named arguments. The keys will be
# "even" and/or "odd", and the values will be a list of numbers.
# When the key is "odd", you should extract only the odd numbers from its list. When the key is "even", you should
# extract only the even numbers from its list.
# The function should return a dictionary sorted by the length of the lists in descending order. There will be no case
# of lists with the same length.
